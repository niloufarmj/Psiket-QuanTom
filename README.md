# QuanTom and Jerry



## Overview
**QuanTom** is an educational game that merges the classic cat-and-mouse chase with the puzzling principles of quantum mechanics. Based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, you will try to catch the mouse named Jerry while navigating the challenges of quantum uncertainty!

## Objective
Catch Jerry! Stay over him for a few seconds to win.

## Controls

- **Movement:**  
  Use **WASD** or the arrow keys to move QuanTom.  
  Press **Shift** to sprint.

- **Uncertainty Levels:**  
  Use the **Z/X** or arrow keys to toggle between uncertainty levels.

- **Difficulty Adjustment:**  
  Change the game's difficulty on the Home page using the slider. A higher difficulty means you'll need to stay on Jerry longer.

- **Mouse Controls:**  
  You can also adjust the uncertainty level by sliding the controls with your mouse.

- **Mobile Support:**  
  The game is fully controllable on mobile devices using touch gestures.

## Uncertainty Levels
The uncertainty levels consist of two main components:

1. **Position:**  
   Increasing the position level enhances your clarity on Jerry's location, resulting in fewer Jerrys appearing on the screen.

2. **Momentum:**  
   Increasing the momentum level makes Jerrys easier to catch, as they will move more predictably.

> Keep in mind: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that you cannot be sure of a quantum object's position (x) and momentum (p) at the same time!

## Educational Value
QuanTom and Jerry is designed to introduce players to the intriguing concepts of quantum mechanics through gameplay. By understanding the balance between position and momentum, players gain insights into one of the fundamental principles of physics.

## Development
This game is developed as part of the **QGame** initiative by Psiket Academy.
